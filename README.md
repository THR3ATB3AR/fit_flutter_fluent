**FitFlutterFluent** is a Flutter-based application designed to browse and download FitGirl Repacks. This project is a rewrite of the original [FitFlutter](https://github.com/THR3ATB3AR/fit_flutter), with a core focus on implementing the **Microsoft Fluent Design System** for a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. It provides a convenient, cross-platform way to access FitGirl's extensive library of compressed game installers. Think of it as a *very* unofficial FitGirl client. This project is intended for educational purposes and to further improve my Flutter and UI/UX design skills.

**Disclaimer:** This application is not affiliated with or endorsed by FitGirl. Using this application to download copyrighted material without permission is illegal in many jurisdictions.
