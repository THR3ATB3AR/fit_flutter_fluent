**FitFlutterFluent** is an unofficial, cross-platform client for browsing and downloading from FitGirl Repacks and GOG Games, rebuilt from the ground up with the Microsoft Fluent Design System. As a complete rewrite of the original [FitFlutter](https://github.com/THR3ATB3AR/fit_flutter), this application offers a modern, intuitive, and visually stunning interface to access an extensive library of games.

This project was created for educational purposes to enhance my skills in Flutter and UI/UX design.
